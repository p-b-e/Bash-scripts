# Bash-scripts
# 🐚 Bash Script Playground

A personal repository dedicated to **learning, testing, and mastering Bash scripting** through practical experiments and real-world use cases.

This repo is a **hands-on lab** where I explore shell scripting concepts ranging from basics to advanced automation patterns used in DevOps, system administration, and security contexts.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice Bash scripting in a structured way  
- Experiment with shell features safely  
- Build reusable snippets and utilities  
- Strengthen Linux & automation skills for DevOps / DevSecOps roles  
- Keep a clear record of progress and experiments  

This repository is **not a polished framework** — it’s a learning and testing ground by design.
